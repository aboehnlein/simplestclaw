## What is this?

simplestclaw makes it dead simple to get OpenClaw running - either on your own machine or in the cloud. No complex setup, no Telegram bots, just click and go.

**Two ways to use it:**

1. **Local (Free)** - Download our desktop app, it bundles OpenClaw and runs on your machine
2. **Hosted (~$5/mo)** - Click "Deploy on Railway" and get a cloud instance in 60 seconds
